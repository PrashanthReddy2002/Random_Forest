# Random_Forest
# PROJECT TITLE

Classify the random forest algorithm using skit learn classifier using "RandomForestClassifier" for iris.csv,and predict the data how many species are interconnected with N th DecisionTree node.

# TASK

Task1:Import random forest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble library

Task2:Load your data using seaborn graphics library using as an argument load_iris().

Task3:Preprocess the data using skitlearn graphics library.

Task4:Select the model using "Modern_Selection" from sns as a seaborn and sklearn as a skitlearn as a machine learning library

Task5:Load iris.csv dataset for "data" as a input variable and "Target" as a functionable output variable.

Task6:Choose the train and test data using argumental library train_test_split.

Task7:Select the estimators as a Nth Decision Tree.

Task8:Use a random forest classifier and fit your model.

Task9:Find your model accuracy.

#CONCLUSION

My model has the approach of 1.00 accuracy,which lies between the range of 0 to 1.

Hennce it shows that RandomForest Decision model successfully implemented.
